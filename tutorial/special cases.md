# Special Cases and Questions for Kilosort Decisions

### 1. What happens when there is more than one similar unit when comparing?

 * Compare them in sets of two as well as comparing them all together. 
 * If all of the units look good together, merge and compare to others.
 * If only some of the units look good enough to merge, then merge only those and evaluate the left over ones.
* Only mark the last one good if it isn't causing you trouble in other decisions.
* Focus mainly on the cross-correlograms, refractory periods are the most important.


### 2. What happens when half of the channels show MUA but the other half look really nice?
* As long as the main channelâ€™s waveform looks good, then it is okay to ignore the MUA in the other channels. 
* This could just be because of a lot of activity happening at the same time.


### 3. What do bursting cells look like and how do you analyze them?
* Bursting cells will have very similar shapes to their waveforms but just dip slightly lower/higher like shown below.


### 4. What happens when there is a clear refractory period, but only on one side of the CCG?
* It is only good to consider it a refractory period if there is a dip from both sides.
* If it is fully flat on one side, then lean towards not merging.


### 5. What happens when one of the units doesn't have enough spikes to show the CCG/ACG?
* If there is so few spikes for no ACG to show up, then throw the unit out to MUA.
* If the unit has similarities in every other aspect yet there is no CCG, consider merging.
    * This is dependent on the application of the data, which is more important to your project: more spikes or spike quality?


### 6. What happens when there is a large spike in the middle of a CCG but there is no other contamination in the gap?
* A large spike in the middle means that the program is either double counting the same spikes or these two separate .
* The trace view can look at individual spikes and determine whether or not it is actually double counted
* With these, you keep the better unit.
    * This will most likely be the one with more spikes, but if the one with more spikes is significantly worse than the other, keep the other one.
